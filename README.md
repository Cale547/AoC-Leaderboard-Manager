# AoChie (working title), an AoC leaderboard bot 

Features:
- Pulls private leaderboards from the Advent of Code website
- Stores the various data in a database (this intermediate step may be entirely unnecessary but it's fun/cool since we're doing database stuff in school
- Integrates with a Discord bot with commands to retrieve data such as star amount for a specific user, when the last star was got etc.
